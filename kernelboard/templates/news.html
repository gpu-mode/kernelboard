(Mini) Competition #3: AlphaFold's Triangle Multiplicative Update
(June 16, 2025)</h2>

<p><i>“This is a really really fun + impactful problem for kernel devs.
good luck :p” — az</i></p>
<p>

A lot of the kernels / problems you will see in these GPU MODE kernel writing
competitions center around large language model training &mdash; our last
competition, for example, centered around popular single-device kernels used in
DeepSeek-V3/R1. Many future problems may also revolve around communication
kernels where we provide a whole node such as the expert parallelism MoE.

<p>
Many of these kernels we have in mind have already been heavily optimized by
experts in labs like DeepSeek, OpenAI, Anthropic, Google DeepMind, etc. so we
wanted to design some problems that were still interesting, but had real use
cases when solved. The first problem that immediately came to mind was the
Triangle Multiplicative Update used in AlphaFold2 and AlphaFold3, a series of
extremely influential works in the BioML space that led to John Jumper and Demis
Hassabis winning the Nobel Prize in Chemistry. This operator is particularly
nasty due to its cubic \(O(n^3)\) operations. The peak memory of this operator is
so bad that most implementations of AlphaFold3 (see Ligo's OSS reproduction and
MIT's Boltz-2) keep the batch size during training at 1, despite the models
being &lt;1B in parameter size!

<p>
Now enough motivation, it's time to <b>get coding!</b>

AMD Developer Challenge 2025: Inference Sprint (April 15, 2025)</h2>

<p>
We are excited to announce the $100K competition hosted by
<a href="https://x.com/AMD">@AMD</a> as part of the first round of our GPU
kernel leaderboard! The theme is writing LLM inference kernels on AMD MI300s,
provided for free through the
<a href="https://www.discord.gg/gpumode">GPU MODE Discord</a>.
</p>

<p>
You (and anyone around the world) can participate for FREE by signing up
<a href="https://www.datamonsters.com/amd-developer-challenge-2025#wf-form-AMD-Email-Form">here</a>.
The format consists of three kernels that are core to DeepSeek's LLM inference:
FP8 GEMM, Multi-Head Latent Attention, and Fused MOE!
</p>

<p>
Competitors will target the AMD MI300 using Triton, but other DSLs and languages
that target AMD hardware are permitted! Participants can form teams of three
when competing, and prizes will be awarded based on team rankings averaged over
the three kernels.
</p>

<p>
Special thanks to <a href="https://x.com/AMD">@AMD</a>,
<a href="https://x.com/indianspeedster">@indianspeedster</a>, and the
amazing GPU MODE Project Popcorn core devs,

<a href="https://x.com/marksaroufim">@marksaroufim</a>, ngc92 (Erik S.), and
<a href="https://github.com/b9r5">@b9r5</a> for making this competition
possible.
</p>

<p>
We're very excited to accelerate AI research by building on kernels, and we're
super grateful for all of the support from the community!
</p>

<p>
If you're interested in collaborating with us on future competitions / kernels
you think are important, definitely reach out to any one of us on the Popcorn
team!
