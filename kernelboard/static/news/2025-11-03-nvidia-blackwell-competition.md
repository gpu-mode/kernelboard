The wait is over -- it's go time! 

GPU MODE is teaming up with [NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.com/), [Sesterce](https://cloud.sesterce.com/compute?referralCode=SES-KNYPOQ-3b6e), and [Dell](https://www.dell.com) to launch a brand new kernel competition, and you’re invited to push the limits of low-bit kernels on NVIDIA B200s.

With the release of [CuTe DSL / CUTLASS 4.0](https://docs.nvidia.com/cutlass/media/docs/pythonDSL/cute_dsl_general/dsl_introduction.html) and many more pythonic kernel DSLs, there has been a lot of interest in finding problems to practice and learn how to write kernels in Python. This competition is the perfect opportunity for both beginners and experts to learn and compete on the newest NVIDIA Blackwell B200s — all for free! We are excited to see how close you can get to speed-of-light!

The focus of the competition will be common low-bit, single-device kernels for deep learning workloads in the [NVFP4](https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/introducing-nvfp4-for-efficient-and-accurate-low-precision-inference/) format. Like other GPU MODE competitions, we will provide written descriptions of each problem, as well as reference code in CuTe DSL to get started. All testing, reference, and template code will be open-source during the competition as well. 

Over the next 3 months, we will release 4 problems for you to optimize:
* NVFP4 Batched GEMV
* NVFP4 GEMM
* NVFP4 Gated Dual GEMM
* NVFP4 Grouped GEMM

## Prizes
One grand prize winner will receive a **Dell Pro Max with a GB300** from our generous sponsors! Grand prize goes to the author of the kernel closest to the speed of light, across all problems. We will also have additional prizes for each of the 4 problems:
* 1st Place. NVIDIA DGX Spark + GTC 2026 Pass
* 2nd Place. NVIDIA RTX 5090 + GTC 2026 Pass
* 3rd Place. NVIDIA RTX 5080

## Logistics
Please register at [https://luma.com/9n27uem4](https://luma.com/9n27uem4) to be eligible for prizes.
* Registration is open until Feb 13. 
* Winners who can attend GTC 2026 will receive their prizes with an award ceremony.
